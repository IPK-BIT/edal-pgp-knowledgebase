e!DAL stands for electronic Data Archive Library. Its main features are version tracking, metadata management, information retrieval, journal and founding agency proven registration of persistent identifiers (DOI), an embedded HTTP(S) server for public data access, access as a network file system, and a scalable storage backend.
