Immediately after you click **"Submit"** in the e!DAL-PGP web interface, the system initiates two parallel actions: sending you a confirmation of receipt and notifying the curation team to begin their assessment.

## 1. Confirmation of Receipt

You will receive an automated email from the e!DAL system (`edal@ipk-gatersleben.de` or similar) sent to the email address associated with your login.

This email serves as your official **proof of submission** and contains:

* **Submission ID:** A unique identifier for your request (keep this for any support inquiries).
* **Timestamp:** The exact date and time of your submission.
* **License Agreement:** A PDF copy of the **Data Deposition and License Agreement** that you accepted during the submission wizard.

:::note[Check your Spam Folder]
If you do not receive this email within 15 minutes, please check your spam folder. If it is still missing, contact the support team, as your submission might not have been processed correctly.

## 2. Triggering the Review Process

Simultaneously, this email alerts the **IPK Data Stewardship Team**.

* **Status Change:** Your dataset status in the system changes from *Draft* to *Under Review*.
* **Reviewer Assignment:** The system notifies the technical and scientific reviewers that a new dataset is ready for inspection.

## Next Steps

Once the review team picks up your submission, they will evaluate it against the criteria mentioned in the previous step. You will be notified via email if any changes are required.
