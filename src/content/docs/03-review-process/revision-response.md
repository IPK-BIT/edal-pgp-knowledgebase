After the internal review (and any necessary revisions) is completed, you will receive a second automated email: the **Review Response Email**.

This email contains the final decision regarding your submission. There are two main outcomes:

## 1. Rejection Response

If your submission still does not meet the necessary quality criteria after revision, it may be rejected.

* **Feedback:** The email will contain detailed reasons for the rejection (e.g. "Metadata insufficient," "Files corrupted").
* **Action:** You have the chance to correct the issues and **re-submit** the dataset as a new request.

## 2. Acceptance Response

If your dataset is approved, congratulations! The email will provide three important links that allow you to control the final publication step.

### Link 1: Preview Link (Restricted Access)
* **What it is:** A private, temporary link to your dataset's landing page.
* **Status:** This is **not** a DOI yet. The data is technically "published" but hidden.
* **Use Case:** You can share this link with **journal reviewers** during the peer-review process of your manuscript. It proves the data exists and is accessible without making it public before your paper is accepted.

### Link 2: DOI Assignment Link (Final Publication)
* **Action:** Clicking this link confirms your intent to publish.
* **Result:**
    1.  The **DOI is minted** and registered with DataCite.
    2.  The dataset becomes **permanently public**.
    3.  You can now include this DOI in your final research paper.

:::danger[Point of No Return]
Once you click the **DOI Assignment Link**, the dataset is immutable. You cannot delete it or change files anymore.

### Link 3: Cancel Submission
* **Action:** Withdraws your submission entirely.
* **Use Case:** Use this if you realized you uploaded the wrong data or no longer wish to publish it.
