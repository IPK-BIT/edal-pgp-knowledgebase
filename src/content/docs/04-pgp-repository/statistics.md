In e!Dal-PGP's [Request – Statistics page](https://doi.ipk-gatersleben.de/report), you can find a compact overview about the accesses and downloads of all stored datasets.
For each dataset record, the following statistics are available:
  
  - The number of **Distinct IPs** by which a record was downloaded
  - The **Download volume**, summing up the data volume of all downloads of that record
  - A **Map**, indicating where the data was downloaded for reuse
