Here we explain how to submit data to e!DAL-PGP using the e!DAL-PGP Web Submission tool. 

## Authentication

Before you can start a submission, you must authenticate yourself. The system supports two primary login methods:

* **Keycloak:** For institutional users (e.g. IPK staff).
* **LS Login (Life Science Login):** For external users via the ELIXIR AAI network.

Once logged in, click the **"Submission"** button on the dashboard to initiate the process. The submission process consists of 4 steps.
